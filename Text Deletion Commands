You may want your website to look different on different days of the week. In the script below I'm going to show you simply how to change the background color based on the day of the week. You can take this one step further if you want and pull entirely different style sheets for each day. This would allow your website to feature your daily specials, celebrate Fridays, or just have a fun new look each day!
